NAME
     pict2png -- convert Macintosh PICT images to PNG images

SYNOPSIS
     pict2png [options] source [destination]

DESCRIPTION
     pict2png is a utility for converting files in the Macintosh PICT image
     format to the PNG image format.  Images with an associated (premulti-
     plied) alpha channel are detected and properly converted as needed.

OPTIONS
     pict2png supports the following command line options.

     --delete
	      Delete the original PICT files as each is successfully converted
	      to the PNG format (use with caution)

     --dry-run
	      Runs through the process of loading and converting each PICT
	      file, but does not write out PNG file or delete the PICT files.

     --bkgnd-ratio=RATIO
	      Adjust required ratio of detected background color to other
	      background colors that may be present (defaults to 0.8)

     --force  Forces conversion of files that have issues (detected background
	      color ratio not sufficient; associated background not black or
	      white; failure to determine the alpha channel type)

     --verbose
	      Displays additional status messages for each PICT file.

     --quiet  Do not display summary at end of conversion process.

     --help   Display usage information

     --version
	      Display version information

EXAMPLES
     pict2png /path/to/source.pct

     The specified PICT file is converted and the resulting PNG file placed
     next to it in the same folder.  Any existing PNG file is overwritten.

     pict2png /path/to/source/folder --delete

     The specified folder is traversed and any PICT files that are found are
     converted.  The resulting PNG files are placed next to the original PICT
     files.  Any existing PNG files are overwritten and the original PICT
     files are deleted.

     pict2png /path/to/source/folder /path/to/destination/folder

     The source folder is traversed and any PICT files that are found are con-
     verted.  The directory structure of the source folder is created in the
     destination folder and resulting PNG files are placed in the appropriate
     location.	Any existing PNG files are overwritten.

RETURN CODES
     The pict2png utility returns 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     1 : Command syntax error; no files processed.

     2 : Error processing one or more files.
