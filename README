pict2png v1.0.3

pict2png is a utility for converting files in the Macintosh PICT image
format to the PNG image format.  Images with an associated (premulti-
plied) alpha channel are detected and properly converted as needed.

Details on how to use the software can be found in the man page.

Please note that pict2png requires Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard and that
ImageMagick and supporting libraries should be installed in /usr/local.
It is critical that ImageMagick was compiled with the --disable-openmp flag.
